To run veros on cartesius you need to load a Python 3 module, a HDF5 module and PETSc.
The modules compiled with the intel compiler seems to NOT work. Instead ise packages compiled with the opensource set of compilers (foss).
I loaded the packages with the following commands:

module load 2019
module load Python/3.7.5-foss-2018b HDF5/1.10.2-foss-2018b PETSc/3.11.2-foss-2018b foss/2018b

In the future an intel compiled python might work with veros, and in that case it is most likely FASTER

You can use the file "veros_cart_submit.sh" to submit a veros run on cartesius via the sbatch command
